### Welcome to NoxV9Database a database written in rust to handel data from my multi-media database (NoxDatabase)

#### goal of NoxV9Database

* first one is to have a custom datastorage device that I can configure as i please. 
* secound thing I want is a easy way to connect it to my ongoing projects via NoxDatabase.
* third I want it to be fast and a easy to use. 

#### specs

* I will use rust as the language and some kind of clinet server layout to comunicate via the server. 
* I will also write a cutsom nodejs framework to handle communication to the database. 
* Might need to add support for more languages later on but we will start with nodejs implementation.
