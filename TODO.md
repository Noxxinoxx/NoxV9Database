## NoxV9WorkDatabase impl

change so database can send out listerners.
so if a program i connected to the database and we change a value that the program is listering to send a notis to the program and tell them that a value has been changed.
that means that we can minimize the request sent to the database. instead of spamming the database for info every secound we can just say that the database will send a notis when a value has been changed.
